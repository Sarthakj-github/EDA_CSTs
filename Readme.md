# 🛍️ Customer Shopping Trends – EDA & Data Cleaning

This project explores and analyzes customer shopping behavior using the [Customer Shopping Trends Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-shopping-dataset). The main goal is to clean the dataset, perform feature engineering, and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive meaningful business insights.
