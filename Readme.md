## 📂 Dataset

**Source**: [Kaggle - Customer Shopping Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/customer-shopping-trends-dataset)

- **Records**: 3,900
- **Features**: 18
- **Includes**: Gender, Age, Item Purchased, Category, Subscription Status, Purchase Amount, Discount, Promo Code, Payment Method, etc.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw categorical data
- Convert useful columns to numeric flags (e.g., discount used, promo applied)
- Perform detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize trends and extract actionable insights

## 🔍 Key Insights Explored

1. **Gender vs. Purchase Amount**  
   Compare the average purchase amount between male and female customers.

2. **Top Product Categories**  
   Identify which product categories contribute the most to revenue.

3. **Subscription Status vs. Total Spend**  
   Visualize how subscription status correlates with overall spending. Subscribed customers may have a higher average spend.

4. **Discounts Applied vs. Purchase Amount**  
   Does applying a discount lead to higher purchases, or is it just a marketing tactic with no impact?

5. **Shipping Type vs. Purchase Frequency**  
   Analyze whether customers who choose faster shipping methods purchase more frequently.

6. **Seasonal Trends**  
   Create a heatmap or line plot showing seasonal trends in total sales or purchase frequency.

7. **Payment Method vs. Average Spend**  
   Compare the total purchase amount based on the payment method used.

8. **Location Insights**  
   Identify locations with the highest spend or most frequent purchases.
